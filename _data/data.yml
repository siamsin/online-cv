        As a Senior Engineer in the Method Development Group. My job is related to 
        mathematical modelling of automotive systems to predict how much of a 
        system/vehicle performance we can achieve to ensure First Time Right and 
        Every Time Right design. I developed applications such as sound transmission 
        loss of mufflers, torsional vibration of drivelines and vibro- acoustics of 
        steering hose, to name a few.
